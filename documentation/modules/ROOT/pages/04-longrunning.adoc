= Long Running Workflows

include::_attributes.adoc[]

Having a graphical notation to orchestrate services is nice, but you might wonder if it is worth it!

The real power of a workflow engine gets into action when the workflow is *long running*: in other words, when it reaches a pause status, because it has to wait an asynchronous event, a manual intervention or a timer.

In this section, you will evolve the workflow to add this long running nature!

From a use case perspective, the workflow has to wait for an _asynchronous_ event which confirms the completion *shipment procedures*. 

The following picture shows an high level design:

[#waitevent]
== Wait Event Sprint

For sake of simplicity, let's imagine that an external integration service is able to homogenize events arriving from the internal department and those arriving from the external supplier.

The event will bring an important information the *correlation key*, in our use case is the `orderId`.
As the name implies, the correlation key is important to address the correct workflow instance.

The *correlation key MUST BE initialized* at creation time with an incoming *CloudEvent*.

This implies two _catching event nodes_ are required:

* one at the beginning of the flow to start the workflow

* another after the `Prepare for Shipping` and `Forward to External Supplier` to wait the shipping event

//-
Open the workflow editor and follow these steps:

. Before the `start` declaration, *add* the following _event declaration_:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
events:
- name: orderEvent
  kind: consumed
  type: OrderEventType
  source: Client
  correlation:
  - contextAttributeName: orderid
- name: shippingEvent
  kind: consumed
  type: ShippingEventType
  source: Shipper
  correlation:
  - contextAttributeName: orderid
----
+
The definition is quite self explanatory: the workflow can *consume* two different *types of events*: `OrderEventType` and `ShippingEventType`, from two different *sources*. 
One important aspect is the _correlation definition_ which says that _CloudEvent_ has to carry a special *attribute in the header* named `orderid` (CloudEvents attributes must be _lowercase_).

. Add an *_event state_* at the beginning of the workflow:

.. *Insert* the following immediately after the declaration of `states`:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
- name: Order Received
  type: event
  onEvents:
    - eventRefs:
        - orderEvent
  transition: Check Inventory
----

.. *Update* the `start` attribute to match the event state `Order Received`, this is the graphical outcome:
+

. Add another *_event state_* at the end of the workflow:

.. *Insert* another _event_ state declaration:

* name: `Order Shipped`
* eventRef: `shippingEvent`

+
+
NOTE: It's worth noting that the order of the declarations is irrelevant, but to make the file easier to read, it's a good practice to follow the same order in the textual representation as in the graphical one.

.. *Update* the `Prepare for Shipping` and `Forward to External Supplier` states to *transition* in the `Order Shipped` event node; on both declarations:

... remove `end: true`
... add `transition: Order Shipped`

+
The resulting diagram is:

+

. To complete the use case implementation, you have to add another operation that is responsible of *notifying* the customer about the shipping status with usual tracking information:

* *copy* the previous operation state `Prepare for Shipping`
* *rename* it to `Notify Customer`
* *update* the message to match the operation name
* *remove* the existing _transition_ and *add* the attribute `end: true`

. *Update* the previous `Order Shipped` event state *adding* the _transition_ to `Notify Customer`

[#eventing]
== Eventing

Events in Serverless Workflow comply to the https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] standard which is under the https://cncf.io[Cloud Native Computing Foundation].

Moreover, Serverless Workflow, and in general *OpenShift Serverless Logic*, aims to fit seamlessly in https://knative.dev/docs/eventing[Knative eventing].

For such a reason, Serverless Workflow exposes two channels to ingest _CloudEvents_:

* HTTP POST
* Kafka Broker

The developer runtime listens for _CloudEvents_ on the root path of the standard HTTP channel (e.g. `http:/localhost:8080/`).
In general, the Serverless Workflow runtime can expose multiple endpoints to ingest different types of events.

[#test-events]
== Test the events

To _start_ the workflow and subsequently _advance_ it, you have to inject two *types* of _CloudEvent_:

* `OrderEventType`
* `ShippingEventType`

Inside the http probing file, there are already 3 examples of _CloudEvents_, for the current test we only need the first two.

1. *Open* `src/test/resources/probe.http` and *identify* the first POST statement after the comment _Start order workflow through CloudEvent_

* Observe the feature of the http request: along with the usual HTTP Headers, there are some distinctive *attributes* of the _CloudEvents_ specification, they all starts with the `ce-` prefix and are lowercase.
* A *special attention* deserves the custom attribute `orderid` which matches the `contextAttributeName` used in the event definition for correlation. 
+
NOTE: `{{orderId}}` is a convenient capability of this rest client that allows the variable defined earlier (`@orderId=1000`) to be used in this way.

* Within the _json_ payload, there is again an attribute named `orderId`, it's required because the CloudEvents attributes are not accessible from the workflow logic.

2. Start the order workflow injecting the `OrderEventType` *clicking* on `Send Request`

3. Check the flow execution through the DevUI. Refer to xref:02-startup-project.adoc#monitor[Monitor the runtime] section for detailed guidance. Make sure that the workflow instance is still running. You should notice the `shippingEvent` is active after the `Prepare for Shipping` operation.
+

4. Inject the `ShippingEventType` to make the flow advance: *click* `Send Request` on the POST statement right after the previous one (pay attention to the comment).

5. To check the workflow instance completion, go in the _DevUI_, on the top right of the workflow instance page, *click* the _refresh icon_:

**CONGRATULATION!!!** Your Serverless Workflow resumes when asynchronous events arrives!

IMPORTANT: The `ce-orderid` attribute is the hook to the workflow instance, you can run multiple parallel workflow instances which will wait the corresponding events.
