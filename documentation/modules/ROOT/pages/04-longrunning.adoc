= Long Running Workflows

include::_attributes.adoc[]

Having a graphical notation to orchestrate services is nice, but you might wonder if it is worth it!

The real power of a workflow engine gets into action when the process is long running: in other words, when it reaches a pause status, because it has to wait an asynchronous event, a manual intervention, a timer.

In this section, you will evolve the workflow to add this long running nature!

[#waitevent]
== Wait an event

From a use case perspective, the workflow has to wait for shipment procedure completion event.
For sake of simplicity, let's imagine that an external integration service is able to homogenize events arriving from the internal department and those arriving from the external supplier.

The event will bring an important information the *correlation key*, in our use case is the `orderId`.
As the name implies, the correlation key is important to address the correct workflow instance.
