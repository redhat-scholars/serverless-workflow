*Cloud Native Applications* often deal with ÂµServices orchestration in order to implement complex long running *business transactions*. Without a workflow engine many challenges arise: lack of single point of control and visibility, inconsistent state, how to handle errors. OpenShift Serverless Logic introduces the workflow capability based on *Serverless Workflow Specification*, moreover it leverages many other cloud native initiatives like _Knative_, _CloudEvents_, _OpenAPI_, _AsyncAPI_, _GraphQL_, and _gRPC_.

In this tutorial you will learn how to develop a workflow to address some common service orchestration challenges.
