This section explores the key elements of a serverless workflow project.

[#structure]
== The project structure

The Serverless Workflow technology was designed according to Microservice Architecture principles.
A production ready solution is supported by multiple services: persistence, data index, dashboards, messaging, to name but a few.

However, in this tutorial, we are going to focus on the core service which is responsible for the workflow logic execution.

The workflow core logic is hosted by a plain Quarkus project with some extensions.

Serverless Workflow leverages some capabilities coming from of the *Kogito* upstream initiative. For such reason, the extensions have the `kogito` prefix:

* `kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow`
* `kogito-addons-quarkus-persistence-jdbc`
* `kogito-addons-quarkus-process-svg`
* `kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow-devui`

Other common Quarkus extensions used are:

* `quarkus-smallrye-openapi`
* `quarkus-resteasy`
* `quarkus-resteasy-jackson`
* `quarkus-jdbc-postgresql`

It's worth noticing that, at the moment, serverless workflow extensions are not aligned to the quarkus platform, so they relies a dedicated _bom_:

[source, xml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
  <artifactId>kogito-bom</artifactId>
  <version>1.27.0.Final-redhat-00005</version>
  <type>pom</type>
  <scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
----

The version `1.27.0.Final-redhat-00005` comes from the developer preview.

[#run]
== Run the workflow

include::partial$quarkus-dev.adoc[]

Open a new terminal and start the process with the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
include::example$start-swf.sh[]
----

You should get back the an output which resembles the following:

[.console-output]
[source, json,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
{"id":"7484e05f-3b95-4ac7-8c09-a2c717a0293e","workflowdata":{"orderId":"order-123"}}
----

In the other terminal where Quarkus is running you can spot the following message in log:
[.console-output]
[source, shell,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
Order received: order-123
----

**CONGRATULATION!!!** Your first Serverless Workflow was executed as expected!

[#inspect]
== Inspect the workflow

There is an important tool to investigate and potentially debug workflow instances:

1. From the Quarkus terminal, type `d`, it should open for you the browser in the DevUI console: http://localhost:8080/q/dev/[]

2. Among other tiles focus on the **Kogito Serverless Workflow Tools** one, then click on **Workflow Instances**

3. Click on the **Order Workflow** instance to show the details
