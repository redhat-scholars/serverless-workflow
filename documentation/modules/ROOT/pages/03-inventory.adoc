= Inventory Logic
include::_attributes.adoc[]

In this section, you will expand the workflow logic to manage a first stage of fictional use case.

[#usecase]
== The use case

NOTE: As any other tutorial use case, the situation we are going to consider is somewhat realistic, but for sake of simplicity we are going to oversee many _real_ aspects. The primary goal is to show the key capabilities of the Serverless Workflow specification, please, apologise for the many naiveties that domain experts can easily point out.

An e-commerce company has to implement the following **order management** workflow: 

* When a new order come in, they need to **check the inventory** for the availability of the items. If the items are available the order will be **prepared for shipping** (picking, packaging, printing label, etc), when the shipping is completed, the shipping department send an event back to the workflow and the customer is **notified** about the shipping status with usual tracking information.

* If the item is out of stock, the order will be forwarded to a **external supplier** who will take care of the shipping procedure, when the **supplier ships** the order, it also send an event back to the workflow, in such a way the workflow can continue and **send the notification** to the customer.

* As long as the order is not shipped, the customer has the option of **cancelling the order** by also cancelling the shipping.

The following picture shows an high level design:

:sprint-note: pass:c,q[footnote:disclaimer[A Sprint is an iteration in the Agile methodology, which aims to be time-boxed, self container and always executable.]]

The final use case will be implemented going through a set consecutive _sprints_{sprint-note}, in every sprint you are going to experience a new feature of the Serverless Workflow specification.


[#inventory]
== The Inventory Sprint

In this sprint we are going to add the **check inventory** operation and based on the outcome call a **prepare for shipping** or **forward to external supplier**.

Switch back to the *Serverless Logic Web Tools* to edit the `order` workflow:

. **Rename** the first state from `Order Received` to `Check Inventory` updating the following places:

* the `start` value
* state `name`
* the `message` content

+
TIP: To change all occurrences in one shot: select `Order Received`, press twice `CTRL-D`, perform the rename, then press `ESC`

. In the `Check Inventory` state, **add** the following definition just after the `functionRef` object (at the same level):
+
[.console-input]
[source, json,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
        actionDataFilter:
          fromStateData: .
          results: '{inventory: .item | test("0+") }'
----
+
This code mocks up the check inventory logic: `actionDataFilter` is a feature to manipulate the workflow data (state scoped), in practical terms it gets the `item` value and create a new data `inventory` which value can be _true_ or _false_ if the `item` contains one or more `0`
+
TIP: The previous logic is an example of the **JQ expression language** which plays a key role in Serverless Workflow. To evaluate and manipulate data is crucial to gaining some familiarity with this language https://openshift-knative.github.io/docs/docs/latest/serverless-logic/core/understanding-jq-expressions.html[Understanding JQ expressions]

. Introduce a new switch state after the previous state:

.. *Move the cursor* to the end of yaml file at state level and *type* ```- ``` (a dash followed by a space) and you should get the suggestion pop up, *hit* `Enter` to confirm the suggestion.
+
image::03_suggest.png[new switch state]

.. *Update* the template keys `name` and `condition` as in the following snippet:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
  - name: 'Item Available?'
    type: switch
    dataConditions:
      - condition: '.inventory'
        transition: 'Transition to another state if condition is true'
    defaultCondition:
      transition: 'Default transition of the workflow'
----

.. Go back to `Check Inventory` state and **replace** the `end` declaration with transition to point to the switch state:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
transition: Item Available?
----

. After the switch, you have to add other two states:

.. **Add** a new operation state for `Prepare for Shipping`:
+
[.console-input]
[source, yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
  - name: 'Prepare for Shipping'
    type: operation
    actions:
      - name: printAction
        functionRef:
          refName: printMessage
          arguments:
            message: Prepare for Shipping
    end: true
----

.. **Add** an new operation state for `Forward to External Supplier`:
+
[.console-input]
[source, yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
  - name: 'Forward to External Supplier'
    type: operation
    actions:
      - name: printAction
        functionRef:
          refName: printMessage
          arguments:
            message: Forward to External Supplier
    end: true
----

. **Update** the switch state to point to the correct operation states:

.. for the conditional branch set the transition to `Prepare for Shipping`
+
image::03_condition.png[]

.. for the default condition set the transition to `Forward to External Supplier`

The workflow diagram should now resemble the following:

[#test]
== Test the workflow logic

Before connecting the workflow to an external service is a good idea to probe it in isolation (i.e. smoke test): in fact, the current actions only print messages in the console.

. *Deploy* the current workflow:

.. *Select* `Try on OpenShift` button and then `Upload "*order*" to Dev Mode`.
+
image:02_upload.png[upload]

.. Wait for the confirmation message and *select* `Go to Serverless Workflow Dev UI â†—` to open the _Dev UI_ in a new browser tab.
+
image:02_devui.png[Dev UI]

. *Trigger* a new workflow instance:

.. *Select* `Workflow Definitions`

.. *Click* on the arrow button in corresponding to the `order` row.
+
image:02_wf-def.png[Workflow definitions]

.. *Fill* in the `Start Workflow Data` edit box with the following JSON payload:
+
[.console-input]
[source,json,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
{
    "orderId": "1000",
    "item": "1110"
}
----

.. *Select* the `Start` button below.

. *Check* the results and the workflow execution:

.. *Switch* to the _Workflow Instances_ page

.. *Click* on the latest instance to show the _Workflow Details_ page

. *Trigger* a new workflow instance with the following payload and make sure that the workflow execution follow the other branch (`Forward to External Supplier`)
+
[.console-input]
[source,json,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
{
    "orderId": "1001",
    "item": "1111"
}
----

Another tool for checking the workflow execution is the *Console*:

. At the bottom of the _Dev UI_, *click* on the `Open` toggle.
+
image:03_open_con.png[open console]

. Among other log lines, you should spot the output of `printMessage`:

[#call-rest]
== Call an external REST service

Serverless Workflow have a straightforward integration with OpenAPIs.

For sake of simplicity, the project contains a Simple REST resource which exposes two operations:

* `sendOrder` to send order to a supplier
* `cancelOrder` to send an order cancellation to a supplier

The link between the workflow and the rest service is the *OpenAPIs spec file*.

The Serverless Workflow expects to find the file in the `src/main/resources/specs` folder and since the startup project already provide it, you can easily consume it from workflow definition file:

1. Inspect the OpenAPI yaml file at `src/main/resources/specs/supplier.yaml`

2. Open workflow definition `src/main/resources/order.sw.json`

3. Go in the `functions` definition section, *add a comma* to the last definition the editor will propose you the two operation available, *accept* the suggestion and add both definitions
+
image::vscode-suggestion-3.png[]

4. *Identify* the `Forward to External Supplier` state
+
TIP: you can click on state in the workflow diagram and the tool will bring you on the state definition line in the textual representation.

5. *Replace* the print action with the function call:
+
[.console-input]
[source, json,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
{
  "name": "sendOrderRestCall",
  "functionRef": {
    "refName": "sendOrder",
    "arguments": {
      "supplier-id":"\"1\"",
      "content":".orderId"
    }
  }
}
----
+
NOTE: The rest service is invoked with two _arguments_, a dummy `supplier-id` (`1`) and the `orderId`.

[#test-rest]
== Test the external REST service

Repeat the test you did before.

In the log file you should notice a different output coming from the REST implementation:

[.console-output]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
2022-12-22 12:58:02,859 INFO  [org.kie.kog.ser.wor.dev.DevModeServerlessWorkflowLogger] (executor-thread-0) Triggered node 'Forward to External Supplier' for process 'order' (e6cdca5b-795c-407a-8c4d-a58ef3e59bc4)
2022-12-22 12:58:02,860 INFO  [org.kie.kog.ser.wor.dev.DevModeServerlessWorkflowLogger] (executor-thread-0) Triggered node 'sendOrder' for process 'order' (e6cdca5b-795c-407a-8c4d-a58ef3e59bc4)

----

**CONGRATULATION!!!** Now your Serverless Workflow call a REST service!

NOTE: You can also notice that the workflow invocation returns a different payload. What's changed? Why?
