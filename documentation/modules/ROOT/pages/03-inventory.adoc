= Inventory Logic
include::_attributes.adoc[]

In this section, you will expand the workflow logic to manage a first stage of fictional use case.

[#usecase]
== The use case

NOTE: As any other tutorial use case, the situation we are going to consider is somewhat realistic, but for sake of simplicity we are going to oversee many _real_ aspects. The primary goal is to show the key capabilities of the Serverless Workflow specification, please, apologise for the many naiveties that domain experts can easily point out.

An e-commerce company has to implement the following **order management** workflow: 

* When a new order come in, they need to **check the inventory** for the availability of the items. If the items are available the order will be **prepared for shipping** (picking, packaging, printing label, etc), when the shipping is completed, the shipping department send an event back to the workflow and the customer is **notified** about the shipping status with usual tracking information.

* If the item is out of stock, the order will be forwarded to a **external supplier** who will take care of the shipping procedure, when the **supplier ships** the order, it also send an event back to the workflow, in such a way the workflow can continue and **send the notification** to the customer.

* As long as the order is not shipped, the customer has the option of **cancelling the order** by also cancelling the shipping.

The following picture shows an high level design:

:sprint-note: pass:c,q[footnote:disclaimer[A Sprint is an iteration in the Agile methodology, which aims to be time-boxed, self container and always executable.]]

The final use case will be implemented going through a set consecutive _sprints_{sprint-note}, in every sprint you are going to experience a new feature of the Serverless Workflow specification.


[#inventory]
== The Inventory Sprint

In this sprint we are going to add the **check inventory** operation and based on the outcome call a **prepare for shipping** or **forward to external supplier**.

1. **Open** `order.sw.json` file

2. **Replace** `Order Received` with `Check Inventory` in the following places:

* start
* name of the state
* the message
+
TIP: To change all occurrences in one shot: select `Order Received`, press twice `CTRL-D`, perform the rename, then press `ESC`

3. **Add** after the `functionRef` object the following logic:
+
[.console-input]
[source, json,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
"actionDataFilter": {
  "fromStateData": ".",
  "results": "{inventory: .item | test(\"0+\") }"
}
----
+
This code mocks up the check inventory logic: `actionDataFilter` is a feature to manipulate the workflow data (state scoped), in practical terms it gets the `item` value and create a new data `inventory` which value can be _true_ or _false_ if the `item` contains one or more `0`
+
TIP: The previous logic is an example of the **JQ expression language** which plays a key role in Serverless Workflow. To evaluate and manipulate data is crucial to gaining some familiarity with this language https://openshift-knative.github.io/docs/docs/latest/serverless-logic/core/understanding-jq-expressions.html[Understanding JQ expressions]

4. **Move the cursor** to the end of previous state, **type** a comma and you should get the suggestion pop up
+
image::vscode-suggestion.png[]

5. **Select** `New switch state`, then **edit** the `name` and the `condition`:
+
[.console-input]
[source, json,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
{
  "name": "Item Available?",
  "type": "switch",
  "dataConditions": [
  {
    "condition": ".inventory",
    "transition": "Transition to another state if condition is true"
  }
  ],
  "defaultCondition": {
    "transition": "Default transition of the workflow"
  }
}
----

6. Go back to `Check Inventory` state and **replace** the end declaration with transition to point to the switch state:
+
[.console-input]
[source, json,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
"transition": "Item Available?"
----

7. After the switch state definition **add** a new operation state for `Prepare for Shipping`:
+
[.console-input]
[source, json,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
{
  "name": "Prepare for Shipping",
  "type": "operation",
  "end": true,
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "printAction",
      "functionRef": {
        "refName": "printMessage",
        "arguments": {
          "message": "\"Prepare for Shipping\""
        }
      }
    }
  ]
},
----

8. **Add** an operation state for `Forward to External Supplier`:
+
[.console-input]
[source, json,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
{
  "name": "Forward to External Supplier",
  "type": "operation",
  "end": true,
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "printAction",
      "functionRef": {
        "refName": "printMessage",
        "arguments": {
          "message": "\"Forward to External Supplier\""
        }
      }
    }
  ]
},
----

9. **Update** the switch state to point to the correct operation states:

* for the conditional branch set the transition to `Prepare for Shipping`
+
image::vscode-suggestion-2.png[]

* for the default condition set the transition to `Forward to External Supplier`

This is the expected result:

[#test]
== Test the workflow logic

Before connecting the workflow to an external service is a good idea to probe it in isolation (i.e. smoke test): in fact, the current actions only print messages in the console.

1. *Open* the http probing file: `src/test/resources/probe.http`

2. Identify the first POST request in the file and just above it *click* on `Send Request`
+
image:send-request.png[]

3. *Check* the results and the workflow execution in the quarkus console

4. Repeat the previous 2 steps to check that the workflow execution follow the other branch (Forward to External Supplier)

[#call-rest]
== Call an external REST service

Serverless Workflow have a straightforward integration with OpenAPIs.

For sake of simplicity, the project contains a Simple REST resource which exposes two operations:

* `sendOrder` to send order to a supplier
* `cancelOrder` to send an order cancellation to a supplier

The link between the workflow and the rest service is the *OpenAPIs spec file*.

The Serverless Workflow expects to find the file in the `src/main/resources/specs` folder and since the startup project already provide it, you can easily consume it from workflow definition file:

1. Inspect the OpenAPI yaml file at `src/main/resources/specs/supplier.yaml`

2. Open workflow definition `src/main/resources/order.sw.json`

3. Go in the `functions` definition section, *add a comma* to the last definition the editor will propose you the two operation available, *accept* the suggestion and add both definitions
+
image::vscode-suggestion-3.png[]

4. *Identify* the `Forward to External Supplier` state
+
TIP: you can click on state in the workflow diagram and the tool will bring you on the state definition line in the textual representation.

5. *Replace* the print action with the function call:
+
[.console-input]
[source, json,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
{
  "name": "sendOrderRestCall",
  "functionRef": {
    "refName": "sendOrder",
    "arguments": {
      "supplier-id":"\"1\"",
      "content":".orderId"
    }
  }
}
----
+
NOTE: The rest service is invoked with two _arguments_, a dummy `supplier-id` (`1`) and the `orderId`.

:!sol-stage:

[#test-rest]
== Test the external REST service

Repeat the test you did before.

In the log file you should notice a different output coming from the REST implementation:

[.console-output]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
2022-12-22 12:58:02,859 INFO  [org.kie.kog.ser.wor.dev.DevModeServerlessWorkflowLogger] (executor-thread-0) Triggered node 'Forward to External Supplier' for process 'order' (e6cdca5b-795c-407a-8c4d-a58ef3e59bc4)
2022-12-22 12:58:02,860 INFO  [org.kie.kog.ser.wor.dev.DevModeServerlessWorkflowLogger] (executor-thread-0) Triggered node 'sendOrder' for process 'order' (e6cdca5b-795c-407a-8c4d-a58ef3e59bc4)

----

**CONGRATULATION!!!** Now your Serverless Workflow call a REST service!

NOTE: You can also notice that the workflow invocation returns a different payload. What's changed? Why?
