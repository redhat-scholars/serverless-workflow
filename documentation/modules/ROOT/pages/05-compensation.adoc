= Compensation

include::_attributes.adoc[]

*Sometimes the unexpected happens*: for example, a customer changes his mind and wants to cancel an order or the stock are running low. Actually, in real world: _the change is the only constant!_

Workflow developers start defining the _happy path_, then they have to deal with unexpected results (out of stock, order cancellation events, etc). A workflow could define a long chain of activities and under certain conditions, it might be necessary to define an exit strategy: warning all parties involved that they *must undo* what has been done before.

When you have *_short running transactions_* (during milliseconds), you could aspire to the convenient *atomic transaction*, but as long as your tasks span over multiple systems this option brings so many drawbacks which make it unrealistic, especially when they run in a cloud context. In fact, in the microservices architecture, the https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html:[Saga Pattern] is a well know practice when dealing with a cancellation.

When you deal with *_long running transactions_*, as known as _business transactions_, that spans of over minutes, hours or days, the [.underline]#only option available# is to revert what was done previously, this could have consequences: for example, Hotels usually applies a cancellation fee when the cancellation is too near to the reservation day. 

A workflow might involve multiple logical steps, there are conditional paths that depends on specific instance data. When the business logic requires a cancellation of the workflow instance, you need to reverse the flow of actions, undoing what was previously done. In the workflow nomenclature, this capability is called *Compensation*.

The good news is that the Serverless Workflow engine helps you in this difficult situations! In fact, the workflow developer can define for each action a *compensation action* that will only be invoked if necessary. Behind the scenes, the workflow engine, when an action is completed, records the corresponding compensation action in a stack. If the workflow subsequently encounters conditions that require compensation, only then does the *engine retrace the stack* of compensation activities to close everything correctly.

In short, Serverless Workflow Compensation is very handy whenever dealing with cancellation!

[#cancellingevent]
== Cancelling Event Sprint

In our use case, we have to deal with situations where customers have to *cancel their orders*. Specifically, if the cancellation event arrives before the shipping one, it is necessary to call for *compensation*: the concrete compensation action depends on the previous execution path, if the item was available, the compensation action will call the internal shipping department otherwise the compensation action will deal with the external supplier.

The following picture shows an high level design: 

image:high-level-flow-3.png[]

NOTE: Given the simplistic nature of the example, one might consider replacing compensation with a gateway followed by compensatory actions. However, it should be borne in mind that in an even slightly more complex flow, implementing compensation in imperative mode would make the implementation complex and error prone.

Below, we will add the definition of the new event type `CancelEventType` and a forking that distinguishes between the two possible input events:

* `shippingEvent`
* `cancelEvent`

//-

*Open* the workflow designer:

. Inside the event section *add* the `cancelEvent` declaration:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
- name: cancelEvent
  kind: consumed
  type: CancelEventType
  source: Client
  correlation:
  - contextAttributeName: orderid
----

. In the state section, *locate* the `Order Shipped` event state and *overwrite* it with the following snippet:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
- name: Order Shipped or Cancelled
  type: event
  exclusive: true
  onEvents:
  - eventRefs:
    - shippingEvent
  - eventRefs:
    - cancelEvent
    eventDataFilter:
      data: '{cancel:true}'
  transition: Is Shipped?
----
+
The new event state definition is able to listen for two different events. 
At the cancellation event, we can see the statement `eventDataFilter` the effect of which is to introduce a new Boolean data: `cancel:true`. In such a way, we will later be able to know which event has arrived.

. Since the event state has a new name, you have to *update* the states `Prepare for Shipping` and `Forward to External Supplier` to point to it.

* Search and *update* the corresponding transition declarations in this way: `transition: Order Shipped or Cancelled`.

. *Add* the following switch state after the `Order Shipped or Cancelled` state:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
- name: Is Shipped?
  type: switch
  dataConditions:
  - name: order cancelled
    condition: .cancel == true
    transition: Compensate Order
  defaultCondition:
    transition: Notify Customer
----

. After the previous state, *Add* an operation to handle the cancel event:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
- name: Compensate Order
  type: operation
  actions:
  - name: printAction
    functionRef:
      refName: printMessage
      arguments:
        message: '"Compensate Order"'
  end:
    terminate: true
    compensate: true
----

. Locate the `Notify Customer` operation state and *adjust* the `end` property in this way:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
  end:
    terminate: true
----
+
This measure forces the workflow termination.

The following picture shows the result of the above procedure on the workflow diagram:

[#test-cancel]
== Test the cancelling event

In this section, we are going to test that the workflow is able to resume the execution when two types of CloudEvents arrives:

* `ShippingEventType`
* `CancelEventType`

Start a new workflow instance:

. *Open* the `Workflow Definitions` page.

. In workflow list, *click* on the event icon:

+
image::04_cloud-event.png[cloud event button]

. *Fill in* the form with the following values:

- *Event Type* : `OrderEventType`

- *Event Custom Headers* : `ce-orderid = 1002`

- *Event Data* : `{"orderId": "1002", "item": "1111"}`

. *Click* `Trigger`

Repeat the previous step to start a second workflow instance with `ce-orderid = 1003`.

Inject other two CloudEvents:

. First event will test the happy path:

- *Event Type* : `ShippingEventType`

- *Event Custom Headers* : `ce-orderid = 1002`

. Second event will test the cancellation path:

- *Event Type* : `CancelEventType`

- *Event Custom Headers* : `ce-orderid = 1003`

NOTE: Even if you trigger the compensation no compensation activity is defined, so at this stage of the exercise you can only look for the `Compensate Order` string in the logs.

[#compensation-activities]
== Compensation Activities Sprint

In this section, you will add two compensation activities for `Prepare for Shipping` and  `Forward to External Supplier`.

Afterward, you will check that the runtime will call them when compensation is triggered by the cancel event.

NOTE: Compensation activities are *operation states*, they could be placed anywhere in the `state` array. However, we suggest to place the definition nearby the corresponding primary state so it's easier to orientate.

1. Locate `Prepare for Shipping` and *append* right afterward:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
- name: Restore Inventory
  type: operation
  usedForCompensation: true
  actions:
  - name: printAction
    functionRef:
      refName: printMessage
      arguments:
        message: Restore Inventory
----

2. Inside `Prepare for Shipping` *append* the following property:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
  compensatedBy: Restore Inventory
----
+
In the workflow diagram you should see the two states linked by a yellow dotted line:
+
image::restore-inventory.png[]

3. Locate `Forward to External Supplier` and *append* right afterward:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
- name: Cancel Supplier Order
  type: operation
  usedForCompensation: true
  actions:
  - name: cancelOrder
    functionRef:
      refName: cancelOrder
      arguments:
        supplier-id: sup-01
        content: '.orderId'
----

4. Inside `Forward to External Supplier` *add* the following property:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
  compensatedBy: Cancel Supplier Order
----

In the workflow diagram you should see the following situation:

image::compensation-activities.png[]

[#test-compensation]
== Testing the compensation

Compensation comes in action when the workflow instance receives the cancel event: repeat the test procedure above.

In the workflow details page, you can see that the corresponding compensation state is triggered as shown in the following picture:
