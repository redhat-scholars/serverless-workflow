This section provides guidance on how to set up your local computer to host a Serverless Workflow development environment.

WARNING: It's recommended to execute this section with a reliable connection. Avoid to run this part of the lab together with other people because of the bandwidth required. Moreover, some tasks will take a long time to download resources.

[#vscode-extensions]
== Visual Studio Code Extensions

Launch Visual Studio Code to install the following extensions:

* Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat
* Kogito Serverless Workflow Editor
* REST Client (from Huachao Mao)

There are 2 ways:

1. Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code, search and install.

2. Launch VS Code Quick Open (Ctrl+P), paste the following commands, and press enter:

* `ext install redhat.java`
* `ext install redhat.vscode-extension-serverless-workflow-editor`
* `ext install humao.rest-client`

=== Configure Visual Studio Code 

Open the `Command Palette`:

* Hit **`F1`** or select from the menu **`View > Command Palette...`**

Type **`Pref`** and select **`Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`**

Add the following configuration key and close it:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
"kogito.swf.svgFilePath": "${workspaceFolder}/src/main/resources/META-INF/processSVG/"
----

TIP: Add the comma as required by JSON rules (before or after depending on the key/value pair position)

[#base-image]
== Pull the serverless data index image

In order to run and test locally the Serverless Workflow project, you need the data index container image, it will be *started behind the scene by Quarkus*. 
However, since it's distributed through the Red Hat official registry you have to login before pulling the image.

Find here the instruction on how to create / retrieve your credentials: https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication[Registry Authentication]

Run the following command to login and pull the image:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman login -u $REGISTRY_REDHAT_IO_USERNAME -p $REGISTRY_REDHAT_IO_PASSWORD registry.redhat.io
podman pull registry.redhat.io/openshift-serverless-1-tech-preview/logic-data-index-ephemeral-rhel8:1.26.0-5
----

TIP: if you are a Mac Silicon M1 user, you can pull the image adding the following parameter `--platform linux/amd64`.

CAUTION: Unfortunately, Podman is not already a first citizen in the Quarkus world, so you need to apply carefully the following instructions,

[tabs]
====
Fedora::
+
--
Issue the following commands:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
sudo dnf install podman-docker
systemctl --user enable podman.socket --now
----

For more information and troubleshooting refer to https://quarkus.io/guides/podman#linux[]
--
Mac::

Leverage Homebrew to install Podman and its required dependencies:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
brew install podman
----

Install the podman-mac-helper utility:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
sudo /usr/local/bin/podman-mac-helper install
----

Add the following line to your bash profile

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
alias docker='podman'
----

Before starting the Podman machine, set it to prefer rootful container execution:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman machine set --rootful
----

For more information and troubleshooting refer to https://xphyr.net/post/podman_on_osx/[]

[#project-start]
== Clone and build the startup project

Get your local copy of the start up project:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git clone git@github.com:dmarrazzo/order-swf.git
----

Enter in the project folder and start quarkus in dev mode.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cd order-swf
./mwn quarkus:dev
----

WARNING: The first time you launch `maven` on this project, it is going to take a considerable amount of time because it has to download all the dependencies from internet.
