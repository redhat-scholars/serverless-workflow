[#base-image]
== Pull the serverless data index image

In order to run and test locally the Serverless Workflow project, you need the data index container image, it will be started behind the scene by quarkus. 
However, since it's distributed through the Red Hat official registry you have to login before pulling the image.

Find here the instruction on how to create / retrieve your credentials: https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication[Registry Authentication]

Run the following command to login and pull the image:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman login -u $REGISTRY_REDHAT_IO_USERNAME -p $REGISTRY_REDHAT_IO_PASSWORD registry.redhat.io
podman pull registry.redhat.io/openshift-serverless-1-tech-preview/logic-data-index-ephemeral-rhel8:1.26.0-5
----

TIP: if you are a Mac Silicon M1 user, you can pull the image adding the following parameter `--platform linux/amd64`.

[#project-start]
== Clone and build the startup project

Get your local copy of the start up project:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git clone git@github.com:dmarrazzo/order-swf.git
----

Enter in the project folder and start quarkus in dev mode.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cd order-swf
./mwn quarkus:dev
----

WARNING: The first time you launch `maven` on this project, it is going to take a considerable amount of time because it has to download all the dependencies from internet.
